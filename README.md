# üí´ About Me:
üëãüèæ The name's Mackenzie. I am a full stack developer who formerly worked as an intensive care unit nurse. I've worked as a community relations manager, an agent, and an engineer for a full-stack application while also serving as a personal chef in Denver, Colorado. My experience working in healthcare has shown me that shoddy software implementation and design can have a negative impact on both routine operations and patient well-being. My exposure to these situations has opened my eyes to the significance of user-centric design and stoked my insatiable appetite for learning more about the inner workings of application development. I am very empathic across all cross-functional domains, and I have been called "Mr. Positive" or "the hardest working person in the room" by my colleagues. I think I'm an excellent developer because I have a team-oriented mindset, communicate openly, and can thrive in constrained settings.<br>If I'm not doing code, I'm probably doing something fun with my wife and dogs, like watching a movie, playing a sport, or exploring a new city in pursuit of delicious cuisine ü§§.
